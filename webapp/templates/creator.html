        <div class="about-prose">
            <p>My wife is a nature lover. On our hikes through the forests of the Pacific Northwest, she's the one who stops to admire the bark patterns on a Pacific Madrone, wonders aloud whether that's a Grand Fir or a Noble Fir, and notices the Western Larch turning gold in the fall while every other conifer stays green.</p>
            <p>The PNW Tree Identifier started as a project inspired by those trail-side conversations. It combines two things I care about: deep learning and the forests we're lucky enough to live near. The entire training dataset comes from <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iNaturalist</a>, a platform powered by the same kind of curiosity that my wife brings to every hike -- thousands of people photographing, sharing, and identifying the living world around them.</p>
            <p>It's not a replacement for a good field guide or a knowledgeable hiking partner, but it's a fun tool for narrowing down your guesses -- and for learning to see the differences between trees you might have walked past a hundred times without a second glance.</p>
